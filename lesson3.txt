When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  I want to have a remote repository if I work with multiple persons on one
  project or when I work my self on a project from different devices. Also I have
  a secure version online when my local computer brakes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  When I want on GitHub only a working version of my project I only pull the branch
  if it is working as I expect. Also I maybe do not want to have a specific branch
  on GitHub and instead only on my local developing engine.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I use forks when I see an interesting project and want to develop my own
	functions for it. For working with other people on the same project I clone it
	and I use branches if I want to do a bug-fix or add a new feature without
	influencing the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You have always an up-to-date version of your program and test your functions with
	the changes your colleges did.
